This file contains some code snippets that were used in a video
discussing the difference between interpreted languages,
compiled languages, and assembly language in the context of
writing a simple number calculator.

The assembly language example in the file add.s was done using
the 64 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS found here:

https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2020-08-24/

If you use the c example, be careful not to overwrite add.s if you compile add.c to assembly language.
